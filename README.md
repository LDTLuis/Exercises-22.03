# Exercises-22.03
These exercises were applied in my college, aiming to introduce programming logic based on the C programming language.

1) Write a C program that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the while loop.

2) Write a C program that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the do-while loop.

3) Write a C program that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the for loop.

4) Write a Portugol pseudocode algorithm that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the enquanto-fimenquanto loop.

5) Write a Portugol pseudocode algorithm that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the faça-enquanto loop (a variation of the repitaaté loop).

6) Write a Portugol pseudocode algorithm that prints any word 20 times on the screen using the para-fimpara loop.

7) Write a C program that reads a word and prints it on the screen 20 times using any of the three repetition structures.

8) Write a C program that reads a word and a positive integer and prints the word read that number of times using the for loop.

9) Write a C program that prints your first name infinitely on the screen using the while loop.

10) Write a C program that prints your first name infinitely on the screen using the do-while loop.

11) Write a C program that prints your first name infinitely on the screen using the for loop.

12) Write a C program that reads an integer inside a while loop and terminates the loop only if the user enters zero.

13) Write a C program that reads a person's age inside a do-while loop and terminates the loop only if the user enters a valid age, which is an age from 1 to 123.

14) Write a C program that reads a person's age inside a do-while loop and terminates the loop only if the user enters a valid age, which is an age from 1 to 123. Whenever the user enters an invalid age, the message "Invalid age" should be displayed.

15) Write a C program that prints 10 random integers from 1 to 100.

16) Write a C program that prints your full name infinitely on the screen. The program can only be terminated by the user if they press the ESC key.

17) Write a C program that prints all integers from 1 to 20 on the screen using the while loop.

18) Write a C program that prints all integers from 1 to 20 on the screen using the do-while loop.

19) Write a C program that prints all integers from 1 to 20 on the screen using the for loop.

20) Write a C program that reads a positive integer and prints all integers from 1 to the number read. Use a while loop.

21) Write a C program that reads a positive integer and prints all integers from 1 to the number read. Use a do-while loop.

22) Write a C program that reads a positive integer and prints all integers from 1 to the number read. Use a for loop.

23) Write a C program that reads two integers forming an interval, for example, the user enters the number 5 and then enters the number 20. The first number must be less than the second number, otherwise the message "Incorrect interval" should be displayed to the user and the program should be terminated. If the interval is correct, the program should print all the numbers in the interval.

24) Write a C program that calculates and prints the sum of all integers from number 1 to number 10.

25) Write a C program that reads an integer and calculates and prints the average of all integers from 1 to the number read.
